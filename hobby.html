      One of my favorite hobbies is <b>running</b>, as it keeps me physically active
      and helps me clear my mind. I enjoy the challenge of pushing my limits,
      whether it's improving my pace or increasing my endurance. This year, I’m
      working towards achieving a sub-2-hour half marathon, which motivates me
      to train consistently and stay disciplined. Apart from running, <b>I also
      love listening to music</b>, as it helps me stay focused and energized.
      Whether I’m coding, training, or just relaxing, I always have a playlist
      ready to match my mood. Music and running go hand in hand for me—they keep
      me motivated, whether I’m hitting the road for a long run or working on a
      new project. <b>I also love watching Formula 1 (F1)</b>. The thrill of the races,
      the strategy behind every pit stop, and the battle for the championship
      make it an exciting sport to follow. <b>I am a big supporter of Mercedes-AMG
      Petronas F1 Team</b> and always look forward to their performance on the
      track. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also teach me valuable
      lessons about perseverance, focus, and personal growth.
